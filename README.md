## What is CleanX?

**CleanX** is an interactive command-line tool written in Python, built to safely scan and reclaim disk space on Ubuntu/Linux systems. It combines a polished terminal UI with built-in safeguards that prevent accidental deletion of critical system files.

---

## Features

| # | Module | Description |
|:---:|---|---|
| `1` | **User Cache Sweeper** | Clears app caches, browser data, VS Code, npm, and compiled Python bytecode (`__pycache__`) |
| `2` | **System Cache Sweeper** | Purges APT archives, core dumps, archived logs, and `/tmp` contents |
| `3` | **Snap Version Scrubber** | Removes old disabled Snap package revisions |
| `4` | **Orphaned Package Discovery** | Detects and removes unused dependencies via `apt-get autoremove` |
| `5` | **Large & Aged File Radar** | Advanced search for the largest and oldest files with custom size and age filters |
| `6` | **Journal Log Vacuum** | Cleans systemd journal logs by time limit or size budget |

---

## Dry Run Mode

CleanX includes a **Dry Run** mode that simulates every operation without touching a single file — perfect for auditing before committing to a cleanup.

- No files are deleted
- No system commands are executed
- A full report is shown of everything that *would* happen

Toggle it on or off from the main menu by pressing `8`.

---

## Requirements

- Python **3.10** or higher
- **Ubuntu / Debian-based** Linux
- **sudo** privileges for system-level operations (APT, Snap, journal logs)

---

## Usage

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cleanx.git
cd cleanx

# Run the script
python3 scfile.py

# Or with sudo directly
sudo python3 scfile.py
```

> If not launched with `sudo`, CleanX will prompt for elevation when needed.

---

## Built-in Safety

CleanX includes a protection layer to prevent destructive mistakes:

- **Critical system paths are blocked** — `/etc`, `/usr`, `/bin`, `/boot`, and others cannot be deleted
- **Home directory is protected** from full removal
- **Virtual filesystems are off-limits** — `/proc`, `/sys`, `/dev` cannot be scanned or touched
- **Symlink traversal is prevented** via `path.resolve()` to guard against path manipulation

---

## Project Structure

```
cleanx/
└── scfile.py        # Main script
```

---

## Notes

- CleanX is designed for **Ubuntu** and Debian-based distributions.
- Some features (Snap, APT) may not be available on other distros.
- **Always run Dry Run first** if you are using CleanX for the first time.
